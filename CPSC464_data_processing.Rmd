print(pca$loadings, cutoff = 0, digits = 2)
round(pca$sdev^2,2)

          main = "Scree Plot of Continuous Variables in Loans Data")
```

Looking at the cumulative proportion of variance, eigenvalues of the components, and scree plot, around 5 principal components seems to be the correct cutoff. 

Based off of these principal components, many variables are correlated with each other and can be grouped together. We will be using the main indicator variables in each of these groups to find the best indicators for loan acceptance using a generalized linear model.  

##GLM creation
```{r}
pca_variables = c("loan_amount", "combined_loan_to_value_ratio", "loan_term", "rate_spread", "debt_to_income_ratio")
data_subset <- loans[c("action_taken", pca_variables)]
model <- glm(action_taken ~ ., data = data_subset, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(model)
```
All seem to be predictors except for the loan_amount group. This doesn't align with what we expected, but the statistical methods may have been skewed due to the large amount of data present and a lack of normality.
